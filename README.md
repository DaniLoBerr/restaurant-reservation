This is the final project of the CS50P course taught by Harvard
University.

This project consists of 5 files:

program. It is composed of:
    - A class called Reservation that includes everything related to
    a reservation.
    - A main function that runs the program when executed the file.
    - 4 validation methods that validate the name, date, time and
    people attending a reservation in a specific format.
- test_reservation.py: In this file are included the unit tests written
for the validation methods of the "reservation.py" file.
- reservation_database.json: This file works as a databse to store
reservations.
- requirements.txt: This file includes the third-party libraries used
in the program.
- README.md: This file explains the composition and operation of the
project.
